## I PASSED CompTia's PenTest+ EXAM!!!

I passed my CompTia PenTest+ exam first time! This was a certification that I had planned on achieving for some time and I am glad to finally have this under my belt.

For anyone wanting to sit the exam here are my tips and tricks to pass first time:

----
****

### 1. Skip the simulation questions
When you sit the exam you'll get around 3-5 simulation questions. These are different from the multiple choice and normally involves a process and matching items to the process. **Don't even look at these questions** until you've done your first round of multiple choice questions. They require a lot of thought and in an exam you need to get off to a good start so seriously just skip them and come back to them. Don't even look at them.

### 2. Read the question
I know this one sounds a little obvious but I can't stress how important it is to **read the question**, particularly how the question is worded. You have plenty of time in the exam so take your time to read and understand what the question is asking.

### 3. Comeback to questions you don't know later on
If you don't know the answer to a question just leave it and comeback to it later. Answer the ones you do know to get yourself off to a good start. You may need just need a bit of time to think about the question at a later time.

### 4. Have a guess
If you really don't know the answer to question after coming back to it, just have a guess. There's no negative marking so if you don't know the answer just have a guess.

### 5. Adopt the white hat mentality
The exam tests the applicant on basic penetration testing knowledge. In the questions, put yourself in the scenario and think about what you would do and what makes sense. Since you're the white hat, what would you do in the scenario given in the question?

### 6. Failure is a chance to improve
If you fail the exam, don't take it to heart. It's just a chance to improve and pass next time! Plus now you know what kind of exam you're getting into, you'll feel a lot more comfortable next time round!

That's all folks, I hope you pass first time too and if you do, share your achievement to others!
