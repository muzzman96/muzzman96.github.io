## Cyber Security Journey 

----
****

### Hello world!

I am a cyber security analyst who has a deep passion for offensive security, aka Red Teaming.  

I have made this blog to share my knowledge and skills learned during my time as a cyber security professional with the aim of improving both myself and hopefully others who have a passion for either defensive or offensive security aspirations. This blog will cover:

* Certifications gained
* CTF / Box Write ups
* New skills / tools learned
* Future Aspirations
* ...And a _few more things_

This blog will develve into multiple subjects including my personal acolades and sharing any information I found interesting or would help benefit the larger infosec community as a whole.
